### Color Scheme

The colors used for this project are mainly blue(#209CEE), grey(#3a3a3a) and orange(#FA5). All the colours give a sense of trust, proffesionalism and excitement in that order. 

### Typography

The font used in the site is Kanit, with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case Kanit cannot be used for any reason. 

## Features
